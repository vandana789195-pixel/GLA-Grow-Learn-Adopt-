                    Every child comes from a unique cultural and linguistic background, and this diversity is a 
                    tremendous strength! When families maintain their home languages and cultural practices while 
                    learning new languages, children develop rich identities, cognitive flexibility, and a strong 
                    sense of belonging.

                    both languages. Any apparent "delay" is actually just the child learning two complex systems!</p>

                    sophisticated skill that shows your child understands both languages. It's not confusion—it's 
                    flexibility!</p>
